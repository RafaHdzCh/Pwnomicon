  This section offers a curated set of manual commands and quick utilities specifically designed for web-focused reconnaissance. It supports both passive techniques—gathering publicly available intel without directly touching the target—and active methods—interacting with the web app to discover hidden elements or vulnerabilities. These techniques help build a rich contextual map of the target, revealing domains, subdomains, technologies, directories, and potential attack surfaces.
